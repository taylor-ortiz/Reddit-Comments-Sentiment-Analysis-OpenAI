kemlfcw,NYC,18p7fdg,0.9,I used to go there many years ago and  my parents would get me the noodles and wontons. I stopped by about a week ago and the food has gotten better in my opinion. Ill stop by again and bring friends next time. Best peanut noodles in the city
kemsgoa,NYC,18p7fdg,0.9,"This is the type of self-promotion that belongs here and it warms my heart.  These types of restaurants are the backbone of our neighborhoods and they sadly get pushed out by obscene rent increases and corporate chains.  Without them NYC would lose most of its character.

I wish there was a sensible way to protect these businesses with some form of landmarking status after they have been in business for a certain amount of time, but I would imagine that it would be way too difficult to navigate and prevent misuse.  For example, rumors of Katz's closing spreads, and that institution should not be allowed to be pushed out."
kemo1og,NYC,18p7fdg,0.6,"Gotta take visitors into NYC on a flat-out tourist crawl after New Years and I was just thinking of making Chinatown a stop so this is perfect - we will stop by for sure. 
Best of luck to you - affording college sucks."
kemw6hf,NYC,18p7fdg,0.9,"I’ve travelled to your restaurant from Harlem specifically for the Peanut Noodles, and they were great! (It’s cash only IIRC, right?)"
keo93dv,NYC,18p7fdg,0.4,"I run the only meat shop on Division Street, right behind you. 

Our prices are as low and competitive as it gets. If your parents and family are looking to lower COGS, reach out to me. I’m at 47 Division street."

EDIT: Delicious. Definitely going back for more."

/r/FoodNYC 

Not sure about this one, but check

Those prices are great. Will stop by next time I'm down there.

Also post in /r/newyorkcity /r/manhattan (not a busy sub, but why not)

Instagram is also a good place to promote your parents place. There are a lot of local NYC foodies on there you could invite. 

Maybe go to /r/AskNYC and post. Ask what are some Instagram food accounts to target. 

Good luck!"
kemms3o,NYC,18p7fdg,0.6,"Damn, really? That's super-affordable and insane!   
Please, it's OK to raise your prices a little. This is NYC, the center of the world and it's not cheap here.  I'm out in Queens and prices are higher! You could get away raising your prices just a dollar and no one would complain.   
Good luck man!"
kemysg2,NYC,18p7fdg,-0.4,Wow… I never would have known there’s a restaurant there because you guys under the awning of what appears to be a grocery store.
kfh8y7a,NYC,18tzyd9,-0.75,"Good. It’s beyond out of control and looks terrible. They moved the bike lane to the westbound traffic side and replaced all that extra space on the walking path with tables filled with garbage. 

Now do all the guys selling fake shit all over midtown."

kfi6rml,NYC,18tzyd9,-0.95,"They need to also do this around Rockefeller Center… it’s insane how many vendors are clogging up the sidewalk with all the tourists trying to get to the tree.

And why the fuck are so many people selling sunglasses at night?!"
kfhny8o,NYC,18tzyd9,-0.9,"Great! Let's do the 360 degree cameras that have carpet bombed the city next. I counted 7 last time I was around Times Square for work.  The signs prohibiting them are up, but there appears to be no enforcement."

kfhqzyq,NYC,18tzyd9,-0.6,"Was happy when this was first announced. No sympathy, not sorry. One cannot argue the bridge path is wide enough to do vending safely, it simply is not wide enough. Safety trumps all, in my book, therefore these had to go. The mayor is free to grant new permits in the nearby City Hall Park if he is concerned, but this is not DOT's problem, whose first and foremost responsibility is the safe operation of the bridge and not whether they hurt the feelings of unlicensed vendors selling garbage on the bridge."
kfhhrc8,NYC,18tzyd9,0.2,Finally!!!! I can walk the bridge without having to hear Alicia Keys every second.
kfisqaz,NYC,18tzyd9,-0.85,Thank Christ I was sick of hearing empire state of mind every 5 fucking feet.
kfhd55d,NYC,18tzyd9,0.4,Good. Enforce ban on illegal vendors in rest part of the city while we at it
kfhad8e,NYC,18tzyd9,-0.3,"lol I saw this headline on Gothamist’s Instagram and the comments were the usual mix of “fascist cop mayor” and “only transplants care about this” and “people are just trying to make a living” and “class war.”

It just blows my mind how quickly liberal and progressive leaning people turn into libertarians the second any enforcement is directed at lower income people. 

Should we have vendor permits or not? What happens when every public space turns into an open air market? Just have consistent rules and enforce them, jfc."

kf68jrj,NYC,18s8uux,-0.85,"The gentleman on the far left in the red keffiyeh is in multiple videos at protests. Seems he's a bit of a professional. He has praised October 7 and called it ""exhilarating"" and ""one of the best days of \[his\] life."" He also wrote an opinion piece for the Texas State University student newspaper about how horrible white people and how he didn't really have to interact with white people until he got to Texas after growing up in Miami. He actually used the words that he ""hates"" white people and that they're an ""aberration."" 

He should be on a terrorist watch list. Anyone who is exhilarated over 10/7 and the horrific events that day really needs to spend some in Rikers. He seems to be getting more and more violent and unhinged. 

Their cars they took should all be towed and impounded as evidence until the criminal cases resolve. That might put an end to these terrorist acts."
kf5wskv,NYC,18s8uux,-0.9,What purpose does this actually serve outside of pissing everyone off who needs to travel?
kf1g8uk,NYC,18rf0yu,-0.9,The fact that this guy has a history of *seventeen* arrests including one for knife crime before this really says all that needs to be said about how messed up the justice system is now.
kf1h2hv,NYC,18rf0yu,0.5,The justice system and PD are certainly flawed and biased BUT we really can’t have a revolving door for violent mentally ill people. Prisons fail at rehabilitating people but that doesn’t mean violent offenders should just be allowed to roam freely.
kf1mqbl,NYC,18rf0yu,-0.9,Horrible. Hope this time this person will be locked up
kf1dsgr,NYC,18rf0yu,-0.5,Only took a few months to escalate into attempted murder.  No ROR for him this time.  Is he going to be remanded to Rikers?  /s
kf1jkqn,NYC,18rf0yu,-0.9,Bring back the insane asylums start throwing these crazy back in
kf243xo,NYC,18rf0yu,-0.95,I got hit boarding the A train by a crazy person on Christmas Eve  sitting in front of me who as soon as I sat down got up told me to stop looking for at him(I wasn’t) and sucker punched me. My fight or flight kicked in and I walked out nose bleeding before the doors could even close and leave the station. Wtf is going on with these emboldened crazy people (also nypd actively discouraging to file a report)

kg2a1wb,NYC,18x62gb,0.6,Have you tried taking him to a vet to see if he’s chipped?
kg288j8,NYC,18x62gb,0.2,"fwiw you posted this on nye, and today's only the first day after the holiday, so thats possibly why no one was picking up."
kg2akd8,NYC,18x62gb,0.1,its because of the breed.
kg2d0fd,NYC,18x62gb,0.7,"Pitbulls have less of a chance at ACC because they are over bred and most people don't want them. It depends on his behavioral eval. If he flunks it he could be a candidate for euthanasia. But generally they adopt out or place with no kill rescues more than 90% of their total intakes.  But if you can't keep him, that is your only option really. 

Most of the rescues are in tough spots right now because like half of their fosters are out of town for the holidays and all their animals in care are doubled and tripled up this week. I foster for a cat rescue and had THREE extra temp fosters for people out of town in addition to my pair of kittens. But people are getting back and things are getting back to normal so you may try rescues again. 


If you can't keep him but can foster him for a short time...they are much more likely to take him into the rescue that way. That will give them a head start on finding a more permanent foster. It's a jigsaw puzzle! 

Good luck! Thank you for saving him!"
kg2wjeg,NYC,18x62gb,-0.7,Most apartments wont accept a pit.
kg2rtwn,NYC,18x62gb,0.6,People need to stop assuming the worst about ACC. Dog will have a better chance at being pulled by a rescue after he has been vetted and evaluated at the ACC. No-kill shelters/rescues get to pick and choose who they want to intake and most of the time the ones with medical or behavior issues will end up at ACC because people don’t want to take that risk. No-kill shelters/rescues also bring dogs to ACC when they become too much of a burden. Recently ACC sent out an email to New Hope Partners about how many rescues kept returning the dogs they pulled back to ACC. So don’t feel bad if ACC is your only option. I would be more worried about giving the dog to someone shady.
kg34rus,NYC,18x62gb,-0.8,"this is not directed towards OP but we need to stop breeding pits. they are overflowing shelters, they are constantly being re-homed or abandoned. there's a reason why, and it's not because they're cute wittle velvet hippos. this needs to stop - it's just a sad situation all around."
kg2kg1s,NYC,18x62gb,0.9,"If nothing works out, I would be more than happy to house him until his owners show up or adopt him"
kg2dyl6,NYC,18x62gb,-0.6,Most people don't want pits.
kg2amul,NYC,18x62gb,-0.75,"Another pit, why are people doing this."
kf050jx,Seattle,18rc66l,-0.4,The only reason I go to coffee shops is meeting people for work. The price of the coffee is the cheapest real estate I can get on demand.
kf0a0u3,Seattle,18rc66l,0.75,"Fuel Coffee (same owners as Ada’s) are no tipping if you’re looking for an alternative. A 16 oz drip is $4, but employees are taken care of from what I understand."
kf094di,Seattle,18rc66l,0.9,Me. Got a Breville espresso machine a few years ago and never looked back!
kf0bd2z,Seattle,18rc66l,0.9,"Yeah, I go all the time. The price has gone up a bit but the cafe I go to just switched to tip-free with slightly higher prices and I'm a huge fan. Distant Worlds in Roosevelt, but Fuel and Adas are also tip free if you're a fan of that."
kf079so,Seattle,18rc66l,0.9,I go mainly for a bit of social interaction during the workday and having a destination to walk to. For me that mental health boost / motivation to leave the house is worth the $5 even though I have plenty of coffee at home.
kf08eor,Seattle,18rc66l,0.7,"I save cafe purchases for when I’m feeling fancy or in a pinch for this reason.

I bought a manual espresso maker so I could start making my own lattes.  $0.63 for 8oz of milk. $1.26 for 17g of the best, bougiest coffee beans, maybe some honey and spices if I’m feelin it.  Plus I get a little 5 minute routine in the morning to get my brain warmed up.

The espresso maker was $230 and the grinder was (edit) $90.  I broke even after 3ish months and now all my beautiful lattes are <$2.00."
kf0c0w2,Seattle,18rc66l,-0.7,"I stopped at for a 16oz latte. Didn’t look at the menu and tapped my card, and saw I had been charged $7.50. 

Suprised, I looked at the menu and saw a sign that said “due to rising costs we have recently raised some prices incrementally” but the menu prices had not been updated yet. 16oz latte was listed at $5. 

50% increase!"
kf0qrvd,Seattle,18rc66l,-0.85,No wonder there's so many lonely people in this town --  community is so expensive.
kf0dcnt,Seattle,18rc66l,0.85,"I've stopped buying much of anything prepared food-wise.  Easier to make on my own, cheaper, and also I lost a fuckton of weight during the covid lockdowns and being able to have more control over calories when I prepare stuff myself has kept it off."
kf0a83c,Seattle,18rc66l,-0.45,"If you are just drinking drip, the getting coffee out is a huge waste of money imo. The rare times that I do order drip, I can tell it has been on the burner too long or it is very weak. I just  do pour over at home."

They wouldn’t give me one , so I asked if I could make one and stick it to the garage with adhesive. They said yes. Got it online, looked official enough, stuck it up It cut down on occurrences about 60%. Not great but better. Just having the stupid sign made people think about the threat.

Sure pass this, I don’t really care but this will do absolutely nothing to rental prices in Portland."
kd3oxje,Portland,18gy8o1,0.7,"I support this, but can we also get rid of the stupid zoning regulations that don't allow for duplex/triplex/quadplex building in residential areas?  And, very likely pass some sort of tax based incentive for builders to not lose money on making smaller homes so that we stop building 3k+sqft houses as though that's what we need, and focus more on building 1500sqft housing so the cost of the final product isn't inflated due to the size of the home being inflated in order to turn a profit.  The whole NIMBY bullshit around not wanting a small set of rowhouses, multiplexes, etc. in your neighborhood is killing the potential to build more dense housing in places that actually need it.  


Nationwide rent control would be cool too, more tenant protections, higher taxes on 2nd, 3rd, 4th homes (etc.) to discourage landlording and put more inventory in the market to help drop prices as well.  That would be neat.  


And in portland there's probably going to need to be a HUGE push for more plumbers/excavation work in order to modernize the sewer system in order to adeptly handle the increase in usage as more people move here.  There's still so many terracotta and brick sewer mains running through the streets that are failing left and right, and we don't have the workforce to replace it in a timely manner.   


Let's invest in people and housing and neighborhoods, not in landlords and bankers and corporate anchors."
kd3zq2n,Portland,18gy8o1,0.65,"It's going to be really hard to solve this by legislating who can own what, since you can so easily create layers of ownership abstraction (shell companies).

And ownership isn't the problem. Occupancy is the issue. If all the properties are occupied, there's no impact on housing supply. If you buy properties to speculate on increasing property values though, you might not want to deal with renters, so you leave them vacant. 

So instead of an ultimately unenforceable ownership restriction, tax vacancy. Perhaps property vacant for more than 90 days of the year gets taxed at 3%, prorated for the vacant portion of the year. Maybe a human owner gets one vacancy free, to allow for vacation homes, but do we really need to make allowances for second homes in a housing crisis? 

Holding property vacant becomes expensive. Hoarding unused property becomes expensive. Insisting on unrealistic rents becomes expensive. Failing to maintain your rental property so much that the market rejects it becomes expensive."
kd482cn,Portland,18gy8o1,0.2,"I hate to say it, but this won't make a difference. We just need more units. The fact that hedge funds are making money off of housing arbitrage is just evidence of an underlying problem in the housing market. We need more units, and unless that is profitable for developers they'll have to be built by the government. We don't have a particularly great history of that, but that doesn't mean it's impossible.

The problem holding back infill development at this point is that single unit homes have reached such a premium price point that you basically can't built multi-unit on the same land area at a profit. So even though we've reduced formal restrictions on infill development, the cost of doing that development and the delays in the permitting process means we're not getting more units."
kd404ws,Portland,18gy8o1,-0.9,"This is a policy made for retweets, not solving the housing crisis. 

Hedge fund bought housing is a tiny percentage of homes, not enough to move the market.  And those homes are occupied, they're not being kept vacant, so this doesn't increase supply.

Also, why is this only being proposed for single family homes, not apartments? This seems like another example of the government coddling homeowners even more.

Governments will do literally anything except build more homes to address a shortage. 

It's so weird to see this proposal be considered left wing, when it's functionally a ban on renters in single family neighborhoods."
kd452g0,Portland,18gy8o1,0.3,"This is not going to make any significant impact on our housing crisis. We have an increasing number of people and a relatively stagnant amount of housing (in the areas where people want to live). 

The way to fix this problem is to replicate what happened on the south waterfront over the last 15 years and replicate that 10-15 times over. More housing will reduce competition which will drive down prices."
kd3zbfz,Portland,18gy8o1,0.4,"Meh.

The state and local government should incentivize building more housing.  Dense housing, near where people work.  Make the resulting neighborhoods safe and enjoyable to be in so that people might be willing to give up an extra 500 square feet of living space in exchange for a lively street with a variety of amenities.

Spur the development of so much housing that the resulting pleasant neighborhoods are affordable, so that a wide range of people can and want to move there.

This hedge fund stuff is a sideshow."
kd3w0fo,Portland,18gy8o1,0.5,"I understand the outrage here, but all this is going to do is prevent single family homes from turning into rentals. This has been tried elsewhere, particularly [the Netherlands](https://reason.com/2023/06/19/study-banning-investors-from-buying-homes-leads-to-higher-rents-more-gentrification/). In fact, the only effect this bill is likely to have is *increasing* gentrification, in that housing in single-family home suburbs will become impractical for lower and middle class renters. The fundamental problem here is that individual buyers are less likely to lease out homes they buy, nor is there much evidence that the presence of institutional buyers meaningfully drives up home prices.

All this bill does is feed into conspiracy theories around housing being bought up and inflated by corporations (it's not), which conspiracies in turn only exists because there's a shortage of housing. We need to be lowering barriers to building more housing, maybe even subsidizing duplex and quadplex developers instead of... whatever this disaster is."

There’s even a vegan, gluten free bakery (Petunia’s), and a vegan, gluten free ice cream shop (Kate’s Ice Cream). There are grocery stores with incredible produce, farmers markets with even better produce, and I can grow my own veggies because plants grow like crazy here. The amount of locally made food is incredible. Like there are two different Portland-based Thai curry paste brands (Thai & True and Thai Home). There’s so much chocolate (shout-out to Missionary Chocolates, best truffles I’ve ever had) and the coffee’s so good that I, a dedicated tea drinker, actually like coffee now.

Sure, there are problems, as you said, but I think you'd be hard pressed to find a city in the US that doesn't have problems, especially since pandemic."
kfk5tq8,Portland,18ufdq9,0.1,"I mean two things can be true—is it a beautiful place to live? yes.

Are the middle class folks who pay the second most taxes in the United States after New York City’s $25M earner bracket upset they don’t get to live in a world class city for that price? Also yes.  Things should get better if you increase prices significantly, and instead,  the opposite is happening.

Since you asked about my favorite things about Portland, for me it's definitely the food. The city has seen some innovative restaurants, food trucks, and pubs that I believe have historically been a key part of its identity. Although some favorites have closed over the past decade, fortunately, a few have found new life in the greater metro area."

kctxwtz,Portland,18fekh5,0.6,"Earlier this morning I saw a post from someone who I guess made a short film about how ""dead"" Lloyd center was.  Everytime I've been there in the last year, the complete opposite is true.  It would be a fantastic place for an indoor Farmer's Market or move the Portland Night Market to it.  More local vendors, artists, etc..  I would love to see a regular ""Vinyl Record/CD/Cassette Exchange Weekend"" happen too.  Maybe convert a few empty store fronts into a Laser Tag arena for local kids and the kids at heart.  Buy, trade, sell - whatever.  Definitely would rather what's currently working with the ice rink over another stadium making the Rose quarter the most miserable traffic bottleneck in town."
kcttnpi,Portland,18fekh5,0.9,"I really love what's going on there, and the path forward for the city that it represents.

They've taken vacant retail space with almost no foot traffic, and offered it at super affordable rates to people who are creative and scrappy. Way too many commercial landlords are just sitting on their hands and waiting for the market to come back instead of taking an active role in helping the city (and their property value) recover.

The crazy thing is that the Lloyd's strategy here actually seems to be working, and people are coming back to the mall. That foot traffic has also pushed out the visible homelessness that was present there a year ago. If you go chat with some of the SMB folks there, they've developed a really cool community between them as well.

If you're at all interested in the city's recovery, it's worth a visit to see a little early stage case study of how Portland can get it's mojo back.

Or if you have an interesting idea, maybe consider contacting them or applying for space [here](https://www.lloydcenter.com/lloyd-local/). Especially if it's a DIY community coworking space, we need more 3rd places!"
kctpc23,Portland,18fekh5,0.85,"Honestly I think the biggest issue is just that malls are still being designed and built as if they will be a huge congregation area like they were pre-internet, but things are just never going to be that way anymore. Malls and shopping complexes are still good to have, but they need to be designed for a modern era, not just replicating what worked when the mall was all teenagers had."

Turn the old sears into a paintball / air soft arena. 

Turn the old JCP into a 2 story go kart track. 

Throw in an arcade that’s like next level pinball in hillsboro. ( $20 entrance, all games free ) 

Throw a brewery in there and some decent food ( maybe they could offer cheap rent to food cart people who want to expand into a brick and mortar )

Do that, and I think this place would be poppin again."
kctz36g,Portland,18fekh5,-0.85,"I don't really understand how the mall's management can be paying the bills (lighting, heat, security) by offering extremely discounted rent to a few stores while most of the other spaces sit empty. It doesn't seem viable for the long term."

It seems like opening the roads and schools again is too much of a hassle. It'd be much more practical just look ourselves in the mirror, admit that we messed up with Waltham, and just move on from that failed experiment of a town."
kdi26wl,Boston,18j5dtb,-0.85,"I live in Waltham, here are my two cents.

The police have botched this from beginning to end. There was another person who died in that incident, someone whose job is statistically more dangerous than the police, but the cops were lightning quick to make the whole entire thing about their guy who died.

On Tuesday afternoon, after school was let out, the school district informed parents that school was getting out in the morning on Thursday, and would be cancelled on Friday, in part because the police department wanted the school buses for their own use. There has been little to no acknowledgement from the cops that doing this was going to create hardships for parents who now had to scramble for childcare, and the lost wages this will cause. At a particularly bad time of year for it.

The ONLY way any of this has been communicated to the public was through the emergency alert system, which is something you have to sign up for. Obviously not everyone in Waltham is going to be signed up, but if you live outside of town and drive in for work I guess you're fucked?

It's not like this was a one day thing either. There were **TWO** days of memorials, and police advised people to work from home and not go out unless necessary on both days, in part because there were going to be many road closures. Did they tell anyone what roads were going to be closed? Nope, this is all they had to say ""This message is to advise that there will be significant traffic delays throughout the city on both days. Major roadways will be shut down at various times during these days which will impact traffic greatly. If you have the option to work from home, we strongly encourage you do so.""

Really? All because a single cop died? The amount of self-importance they have astronomical."

I don't get it I admit.

Obviously it's sad, tragic when anyone dies!  And this officers death was tragic, he was taken too young, in a tragic accident.

But why is HIS death more important than anyone else who dies in a traffic accident?  What about my friend who was killed by a drunk driver?  Why didn't SHE get a parade and universal worship?  She was a teacher, she was a public servant too.

It's gross to me to be honest.  Have a ceremony somewhere, at the police station, even city hall, but... this guy wasn't a god, he was a guy.  Let his family and friends and coworkers mourn him however they see fit, but don't FORCE the entire town to take place in one persons funeral.

Over the next 7-8 hours we inched from 45 and Cullen to Beltway and 290. Finally called it quits and u turned to get back home.

kds6t9h,Houston,18kmanw,-0.9,"My gf and I spent 7 hellish hours driving from Clear Lake to Cypress. Our two cats, who hated the car, spent the entire time screaming and puking and shitting in their carriers. We ended up just going back after realizing it probably would have taken us 20+ hours to get to Austin. You could feel the collective white knuckle tension from the tens of thousands of people around you also stuck in traffic. In 45 years never felt anything else like it. There was also a worry that if we didn’t make it further quickly enough we could get caught on the road in the storm. 

They hadn’t opened contraflow lanes so it took us less than 30 minutes to get home. Spent the next day drinking beers and riding our bikes around the ghost town of our neighborhood."

kfieu2t,Houston,18txvz4,0.9,"You've never had a proper pork chop until you've had one like that. Always amazing. If anything, I prefer the smaller size of the lunch special. Get more flavor from the outer crust per bite.

But in all honesty, I think we all think it's amazing because 99% of places either overcook their pork chops or severely underseason them (or both). It's not that difficult to make a pork chop like Perry's. It's just that no one else does it."

kcn0hke,Atlanta,18ef9of,0.4,"Okay, so there's more going on here than just the title. There is a federal program called 'Corridor ID', which is meant to allow states and other eligible entities to apply for planning grants for intercity passenger rail projects. These applications are reviewed, and we just had the first batch of accepted projects announced on Friday. There are likely to be more rounds of this program, if we can keep a functional federal government.

The important part about Corridor ID, is that, by getting into the program, a project is slotted into a delivery pipeline, with additional federal funding opportunities to support each step towards final delivery. These aren't random studies being thrown into the void, they are studies with explicit process and purpose.

Overall, there were 69 (nice) projects picked out of ~90 total applications. GDOT did put in one application, and a few other states put in applications for projects that will affect Georgia. Here are all the projects, from the [awards document here](https://railroads.dot.gov/sites/fra.dot.gov/files/2023-12/FY22%20CID%20Project%20Summaries-Map.pdf):

***

> **Charlotte, North Carolina, to Atlanta, Georgia, Corridor** (Up to $500,000)

> *North Carolina Department of Transportation*

> The proposed corridor would provide new service on a new high-speed rail alignment between Charlotte, NC, and Atlanta, GA, with potential intermediate stops including Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport in South Carolina and Augusta and Athens, GA, then serving a downtown Atlanta station and terminating at Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, the world’s busiest airport. The corridor sponsor would enter Step 1 of the program to develop a scope, schedule, and cost estimate for preparing, completing, or documenting its service development plan.

***

> **Atlanta to Savannah Corridor** (Up to $500,000)

> *Georgia Department of Transportation*

> The proposed corridor would connect Atlanta and Savannah, GA. The prop"
kcnadiy,Atlanta,18ef9of,0.85,You mean our infrastructure might actually catch up to the early 80's in the rest of the developed world?!? Awesome!
kcn84nw,Atlanta,18ef9of,0.6,I’d be so happy if they build a train from Savannah to Atlanta. I think it’d be a serious boon for Savannah’s economy too. Won’t happen though unfortunately.
kcn6vz5,Atlanta,18ef9of,-0.5,"I used to have to drive to Charlotte all the time for work. I could've flown but when I looked at the time cost, it was six of one/half dozen of another. God, I hated that drive.

A high speed train linking the two Metro regions would be great. And as much as I mock the state of Florida, the fact that Brightline is up and actually running is pretty impressive."
kcnajdg,Atlanta,18ef9of,-0.6,"A high speed rail was proposed and applied for funding around 2010. It was suppose to be a loop connecting atl-Savannah-Augusta, or Atlanta-macon-Jacksonville that never happened. Probably the same fate here. Would love for it to happen nearly 13 years later."

So many Google searches have no results in this corner of Atlanta. But sooooo many ppl live here"
kd1oiuu,Atlanta,18gn4de,-0.85,"I get where the author is coming from- one of my favorite parts of living in the city is the access to ""third spaces"". But South Dekalb has so much working against it I don't see how any of this really comes to fruition. 

If you want it to happen naturally, you need the people in the community to be the ones investing in making it better. This is hard when the area is so downtrodden and dangerous and been in decline for so long- there's little motivation to open a coffee shop when you may not even have a grocery store. The second option is outside investment, which is where gentrification comes in and those third spaces end up being the things keeping residents from staying in their neighborhood (i.e. Summerhill at the current moment). 

I would love to know if there are other cities that have successfully turned around a place like South Dekalb. I choose to be optimistic and have some hope, but this is definitely a straight up hill battle."
kd275ry,Atlanta,18gn4de,-0.9,"I know the brother means well but this is fundamentally another ""Why isn't (insert poorer part of metro here) just like ViHi / Midtown / EAV / etc..."" type of posts that you also see here.

---

It's demographics and many people are moving to places like mine (SWATs) and South Delkab without really seeing them for what we are. We're poor beedroom communities where coffee only means a $1 large at mdoanlds. Most people are in our communities are closer to palliative care or homelessness than they are to consume like 90% of the things the new yuppies here want. 

This isn't to say that zoning reform is bad and that there should be a liquor store on every corner but... its just a little annoying don't understand the economic reality of their new neighborhoods."
kd1kn91,Atlanta,18gn4de,-0.4,"I mean Hodgepodge on Moreland could not stay viable... right near EAV and it was designed to be a 3rd spot... how do you think places like this make it in South Dekalb county?

Everyone wants these ""amenities"" but it takes people with guts to open them... and HOPE that they can keep them staffed, making budget and not a victim of crime or an unhoused hangout."
kd25eaj,Atlanta,18gn4de,0.6,"Change has to start with improving the schools. Better schools bring more families with disposable income and higher home values. If you want a third place you have to have customers that want to stay close to home in order to be there for the family. 

We live in a nice neighborhood south of the city line and every family sends their kids to private schools in Decatur."
kd1nq2s,Atlanta,18gn4de,0.25,">While on the commercial and retail side, there has been relatively little action in South DeKalb outside of new rubber stamps for gas stations, dollar stores, and fast food restaurants. 

So true. I was just having this conversation with my fiance last night. I don't understand why on Columbia Drive and Glenwood there are 8 gas stations all huddled next to each other, very few sit down restaurants (don't sleep on the food off Candler Road though), zero coffee shops south of Memorial Drive, and far too many abandoned buildings. I started a work bowling league and was quickly reminded how fun bowling can be. Sure enough, there is an abandoned alley minutes away from my house. Something as small as that would be a great thing for the community. We wonder why teens are often found loitering outside of gas stations, where do you want them to go? My parents grew up in the area and they talk about how great it used to be, it's sad what is has become now but I still hold out hope (largely thanks to ridiculous housing costs and interest rates). Its incredibly disheartening to cross Memorial drive and go from blight and despair to development and connectivity. 

Development needs to start with tearing down the South Dekalb mall. We would benefit from the cliche food hall development similar to what's been done at Lee and White."
kd1qta4,Atlanta,18gn4de,-0.85,"This is also an Atlanta-wide problem and it was even worse before the BeltLine. Because the City has so little money and we live in such a conservative state, we simply have very few open and public spaces for people to simply be in and lounge around. We have lots of gas stations and convenience stores. Or you pay to enter privatized public spaces like PCM, KSM, Topgolf, and the literally named Your 3rd Spot. And it’s why in the South, it’s a thing to hang out at Walmart, WaHo, or the dollar store. They literally serve as the community center. It’s the world our capitalist society likes to see with zero backstop from our institutions."
kd1oh4b,Atlanta,18gn4de,0.85,And Libraries are almost the only free 3rd spaces left. Other spots expect you to pay.
kd1oagr,Atlanta,18gn4de,-0.5,"I'm running into this issue more and more. South dekalb has cheap real estate, but living here kind of sucks. Have to drive to downtown decatur or EAV for a coffee shop. Don't have anywhere except abandoned malls to take my toddler during the cold months. I've resorted to driving to ikea to let my kid hang out there. South dekalb needs an injection of stimulus, or it'll be airbnb central soon."
kd217fl,Atlanta,18gn4de,0.3,"I'd say it comes down to perception more than factors like income. The Sandtown area and parts of Henry County are demographically similar to the nicer areas of South Dekalb and they don't have as much trouble attracting and keeping retail. In Henry County, the stigma of ""white flight"" hasn't held them back.

It doesn't help that some chains have tried and failed, and brick-and-mortar is not doing well in general. Remember the Sam's Club next to Walmart near Stonecrest Mall? Costco would look at that closure and go ""hell no"" to the thought of a new store in the area. At one point there was a Target in that area as well.

Meanwhile, Henry County just got a Costco one exit north of their Sam's Club and in the spring they got a BJ's one exit south. They're also getting a Sprout's and a few other things next to Costco. In 20 years, Camp Creek Marketplace has managed to retain its retail besides one exception. Both areas also have movie theaters.

Keep in mind, I'm primarily talking about the southeast corner of the county. The area around South Dekalb Mall is lower income, and they face similar challenges as other low-income areas, but not all of S. Dekalb is like this. Change the perception and you change the trajectory."

I don't visit bad areas in Atlanta, but it's definitely kind of unnerving to see all the people standing around in ski masks out on the streets in Macon where pretty much anything other than the interstate is a bad area. That and the starving dogs. I just happened to be there on Monday and I wanted to stop and feed them but the prospect of stopping around so many people just hanging out in full face coverings was too much.

And I peeked over my shoulder and there was a homeless person with a stall door cracked watching me with a deranged smile on his face. Never again have I used a PHL baggage claim bathroom. Its an airport and should be a facility where people should feel safe and sanitary. It’s not a good look when people come to the city and see these people aimlessly wandering around, sleeping, nodding off or urinating and defecating in public view.

kgaca0h,Philadelphia,18yeloz,-0.85,"Couple years ago, on Christmas day, I was walking to the train station to get to my family’s place in the suburbs and had to cross Washington. I watched a Charger blow every single red light on the avenue, as far as I could watch them do it, going at least 45 - light after light after light, past cars, bikers, other pedestrians. I couldn’t stop thinking about how it was more likely than not that someone got hurt that day, or even didn’t make it home to their own family, because of this person. For no reason. And how, even in 2021 or whenever it was, with plenty of technology available that could catch them, they still might evade being caught.

I drive in the city quite a bit and am myself scared for my safety because of these kind of assholes... And mind you, I think those with PA plates are worse than NJ plates


I also think it is more than 10% of the drivers that are shit drivers, not just unpredictable. I used to hate speed and red light cameras but if it were to be put up to a vote, I'd be all for installing red light cameras all over the city and impounding the cars that violate it repeatedly"

The decision is based on the finding that President Trump engaged in insurrection, as defined by Section Three of the Fourteenth Amendment.

The ruling is stayed until January 4, 2024. If review is sought in the Supreme Court before this date, the stay will remain in place, and the Secretary will be required to include President Trump’s name on the 2024 presidential primary ballot until an order or mandate from the Supreme Court is received.

You found a little lane
That took you up to heaven
And ended all your pain.
You may be out of sight,
We may be worlds apart;
But you are always in our prayers,
And forever in our hearts “

Stuff I'd loved in the '60s and '70s, jazz, and then classical. It was possible to find so much classical at Jerry's. But the sound quality could be just horrible, even on records that looked as if they'd never been played.

I was really getting into classical at the time, so I went back to listening to CDs, which were what I'd originally bought. Someone offered me a lot of money for my entire record collection, and I decided to take it. So, no more trips to Jerry's. This was about ten years ago.

For 2-3 weeks before New Years Eve someone in my area kept setting off 5-6 very loud fire works every single night between 10-11pm.  Then on actual New Years Eve (I suspect the same people) started setting off fireworks at about 7pm and kept doing it every 15mins until about 1:30am.  They were all loud but the seemed to save the loudest for once an hour.  Not to mention the several loud off-road vehicles driving up and down the road for hours with sparklers and such.  Never seen such an arrogant disrespectful display of narcism in my life"

kfdu60i,Phoenix,18tbikq,-0.8,"Back in 2017 in High school my class made it an assignment to apply to atleast 3 colleges/universities. I had already been accepted by ASU and fully intended to go there. So to meet the assignment I applied to GCU. 

I shit you not they keep calling and emailing me to this day about my enrollment and signing up. From 2017-2023 they’ve been doing this even after I called and told them I was enrolled in ASU"
kff31ti,Phoenix,18tbikq,-0.9,"Here is a summary of the 3 days I worked for GCU as a “guidance counselor.” (Quotes because the job title was very misleading.)

Day 1: Huge orientation with tons of new employees.  Lots of propaganda about how great they are. Also a lot of talk about God. It kind of felt like I was joining a cult. They were also weirdly obsessed with hating ASU. It was embarrassing how often ASU was brought up. They also made us leave and drive to the campus next door to go to chapel. As an ASU alumni who is not the slightest bit religious, it was a super uncomfortable day.

Day 2: Actually pretty normal training day. Introductions, filling out paper work, setting up computer accounts, etc. I started to have a little hope that maybe this job would work out after all!

Day 3: We start getting into what the job actually entails. It was basically cold calling people to convince them to sign up and get an expensive degree they likely don’t need. Really shady stuff in my opinion. They played an example of a “good” call - the caller was emotionally manipulating this person by talking about their dying grandmother saying things like “oh but wouldn’t she love to see you get a degree while she’s still around!” I knew then that there was no way I could morally justify working there."

This kid was either smooth af or a hopeless romantic. Either way, so cool to read.

ETAA: We have the name of the kid! Thank you to fellow redditors who helped track down the details through archives and public records. The kid's name was John Joseph Pavlo, son of John Pavlo and Anna Matias. Born November 1st 1903 in Pennsylvania. Lived in Minneapolis in 1930. He passed away on February 4th, 1962 at the age of 58. 

So I'm guessing ""John B aka Lolly"" was a nickname and was around the age of 16 when he wrote these love notes to Hazel and Pauline."

However, all these people with their fake service vests cause problems for people with real, TRAINED dogs!

kcragan,Nashville,18epvtu,0.4,"My family and I were attending a birthday party at Big Play in Hendersonville last night when it took a direct hit and the roof collapsed! 

My son dove under a bar area and I pulled a table over myself as I covered him with my body. Suddenly I felt like I was getting sandblasted with wet sand. My wife was similarly sheltering our daughter. There were a few injuries. My wife kept the kids while I went to see if I could help. A man was on the ground saying his back hurt, I advised home to remain still and moved a table to keep the rain from falling on him since the roof was mostly collapsed or gone. I believe he was okay and EMS response was quick. 

My takeaways: 

• It really does sound like a freight train. 

• From “What’s that sound?” to roof failure was probably only 10 seconds. If you are in a tornado warning area: Have. A. Plan. To. Duck. And. Cover."

kd406ui,Nashville,18h1ski,0.2,"Editors note: This past week, Kate Cox of Dallas, the plaintiff mentioned in this letter, left the State of Texas for abortion care.

Its happening in Texas, but Tennessee women need to know.

A pregnant woman sought a medical exception to Texass brutal abortion law, where compassion has no place. Doctors said that because of trisomy 18 (a severe chromosomal disorder) the fetus she was carrying early in her pregnancy would likely be stillborn or die after a short time. 

A judge ruled in her favor because if this heartbreaking pregnancy goes to term, she risked losing the ability to have another baby.  In spite of the District Courts ruling, the Texas Attorney General threatened that any doctor who aided this woman could face life imprisonment.

Now the all-Republican Texas Supreme Court has overturned the lower court ruling that would have let her get an emergency abortion.

Is this what the pro-life movement has come to? Sacrifice a womans ability to have other children in favor of a fetus that has no chance of survival?

Texas is far closer to Tennessee than women in our state may realize. This pregnant womans dilemma may very well find its way into Tennessee, where our MAGA elected leaders are at least as extreme as those in Texas.

Women and our votes are the only hope for a future in our state in which we can make our own decisions about our own bodies and our own families.

When it happens here, where will you stand?

kd4umjy,Nashville,18h1ski,0.5,"I’m moving to Minnesota in two days, and while I’m heartbroken to have to leave Nashville for a number of reasons, it’s actually quite a relief knowing if things go sideways in a future pregnancy (my husband and I want a second kid in the next couple of years), I won’t face the same restrictions I would here. I had a weird and crazy rare string of complications with delivering my son (so weird I actually don’t want to go into further detail because it’s so specific I could actually dox myself, and I’ve had a crazy internet stalker so no thanks 🫣) and while my Vanderbilt OB is amazing and handled it with incredible skill and compassion, I still have increased risks in a future pregnancy that’ll require really careful monitoring. I don’t think my OB here would *ever* let me be harmed in the name of saving a fetus, if it were totally up to him. But so many good doctors in this part of the country are having their hands completely tied by these terrible laws. 

(To be clear, I think anyone should be able to get an abortion for any reason at all, including just “I don’t want to be pregnant” or “I’m not ready”. I’m also a loss mom - my first pregnancy was a really traumatic and devastating miscarriage- and I want to push back *hard* on the idea that some in the loss community promote that those who have terminations for medical reasons are somehow morally superior to people who have elective abortions. I just know I want one more biological child if possible, and my physical issues could make me more likely than average to be in a position to need to have a TFMR.)"

kf6injq,Columbus,18sbttc,0.9,Thanks Zebra!!
kf6q4ke,Columbus,18sbttc,0.3,The Zebra has spoken. Looking forward to an overall mild winter as it has been so far with some storms in late January and February.
kff9zs5,Columbus,18tpyff,0.9,"I admit, I didn't see that coming, but I'm glad."
kffbrm7,Columbus,18tpyff,-0.6,"> Were I to sign House Bill 68, or were House Bill 68 to become law, Ohio would be saying that the state, that the government knows better what is medically best for a child than the two people who love that child the most, their parents,"" DeWine said.

Based. Dewine is actually sticking to conservative principles. Unlike what all the MAGA people want."
kffa141,Columbus,18tpyff,0.0,Woah. So now it heads back to the house to vote on whether to override?
kffff6m,Columbus,18tpyff,0.5,"Slightly surprised but not entirely. The fact that he was taking time to tour NCH and talk to doctors, clinicians, and families spoke volumes toward his intention to take this seriously."
kffbfm6,Columbus,18tpyff,0.9,"I was hoping he'd do this based on his initial COVID response, and I'm proud of him for making a stand."
kffak7m,Columbus,18tpyff,-0.3,I am actually a little shocked.
kffi921,Columbus,18tpyff,-0.7,I saw this coming. It would have been difficult to go on a long listening tour about the issues associated with this bill and decide to go ahead and sign it anyway. The tipoff to me was the fact that the list of people he listened to was not publicized. The other side would have wanted to tell the world about getting to share their views with him.
kffa64h,Columbus,18tpyff,-0.9,Great news!  Now hopefully those fuckfaces in the statehouse don't override his veto
kffcfer,Columbus,18tpyff,0.0,"He's vetoed the bill, but if I've understood him correctly from his press conference:

1) He wants legislation that would make transgender procedures for minors illegal in Ohio.

2) Says they lack details on these procedures even for adults, so he wants reporting on such procedures to relevant state agencies from providers every 6 months, and is asking for legislators to provide laws that would make this happen.

3) Would make ""pop-up clinics"" for these matters either more heavily regulated or illegal. This last one I'll admit I'm unfamiliar with.

He cited the need for regulations even for adults because it seemed unconscionable to him that once someone turns 18 they can start in on care, ""That would have been illegal for them only a few days earlier.""

So the bill has been vetoed, but it's by no means a slam dunk. The Ohio legislature also has a super majority that passed this initially."
kffiaui,Columbus,18tpyff,0.9,"This is the result of Dewine actually talking to families, trans youth, and perhaps most importantly medical professionals. 

Will his fellow conservatives realize maybe their base beliefs about this issue aren’t fully factoring in all the facts? Like maybe doctors actually know what they are talking about here and trans people aren’t demons but real people who are undergoing a painful experience you cannot fathom?"
kcs6yzb,Raleigh,18f78sy,0.25,"Whenever someone says they got food poisoning after eating *X* at *Y* or whatever, my skepticism starts to rise because I feel like many people don't know what food poisoning actually looks like in terms of timeline and symptoms."

kcsal2q,Raleigh,18f78sy,0.9,I hadn't heard about the incident and went there Tuesday afternoon. Got the red curry with tofu and tom kha with tofu and my gf got the orange tofu. Neither of us got sick. Just wanted to put that out there.
kcs58ex,Raleigh,18f78sy,0.6,Good PR move employee
kcsbxlh,Raleigh,18f78sy,0.9,"Fellow employee here! Can confirm that we spent 2 full days doing an EXTREMELY rigorous deep clean of the entire restaurant. I mean we scrubbed, soaked and bleached every surface in the building. The management here has always been very stringent about sanitation practices the entire time I’ve worked here, and they’re taking this very seriously.
I have worked multiple days throughout the entire timeline of folks getting sick, and have not been sick this entire time. I ate our food during at least 3 of my shifts, and haven’t had any symptoms. To be fair, I am meticulous about hand washing and take vitamin c supplements daily during flu season. I typically wash my hands anywhere between 50-70 times a shift (we all wash our hands pretty much every time we go to the back of house)."
kcs6l1q,Raleigh,18f78sy,-0.2,Will the county’s investigation be published once it concludes? How does Sushi Nine plan to counter this bad publicity even if it wasn’t due to poor food handling?
kcsgyio,Raleigh,18f78sy,0.3,Thank god cuz I love sushi nine
kct1kza,Raleigh,18f78sy,0.3,"Many people associate ""food poisoning"" with spoiled food and bacteria, but it fact norovirus is considered the #1 cause of foodborne illness.  The virus must be ingested, it does not infect via airborne transmission, so person to person transmission is less common and is fecal-oral. From the [Mayo clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/norovirus/symptoms-causes/syc-20355296):

*They commonly spread through food or water that is contaminated during preparation or through contaminated surfaces.* 

Norovirus grows to a very high titer in the body and a single ""episode"" (vomiting or diarrhea) releases about 30 million virus particles.  Anybody who entered or cleaned that bathroom was a walking virus transmission agent.  It is likely that the virus was transmitted to the food during preparation from one of these people. You were likely to have been infected the same way, viral particles on your hands made their way into your GI tract."
kcsg3fc,Raleigh,18f78sy,0.5,"Just throwing [this article](https://www.verywellhealth.com/food-poisoning-vs-stomach-flu-5213068) in here for people not familiar with all the symptoms/differences.

Also [the infographic on this page](https://www.gohealthuc.com/library/food-poisoning-vs-stomach-flu) - two big differences are food poisoning typically is shorter and the virus lasts days. The virus also causes fever."

kd17vve,Raleigh,18ga62r,0.3,"sorry OP, i’m kinda confused about your TLDR statement.

i ask because i really like snoopys beef hot dogs and crinkle fries and i’m curious if you had them and what your opinions are."
kd1alp8,Raleigh,18ga62r,0.9,"I love Corbetts and Wicked Links. If you're ever in Durham, I like King's Sandwich Shop on Foster and Geer (surprisingly good cheesesteaks, too) and Accordion Club. It's so perfect to sit in a local dive, have some whiskey, and a hot dog with chili. Or Frito pie. Or a hatch chili burrito on Sunday morning."
kczfe5b,Raleigh,18ga62r,0.2,"It's Cloo's or nothing for me. 

The guy is from the Detroit area (Rochester) and uses Dearborn Sausage company all beef dogs with the good casing that snaps when you bite into it. He steams the buns and the chili is the same as in Detroit. He keeps a 12-pack of Vernor's on hand as well. It's as close as you're going to get to a National or American (or Lipuma's if you're a refined connoisseur...also incidentally the guy that Dan learned the trade from...) in NC."
kd1vtnf,Raleigh,18ga62r,-0.95,"Gonna get downvotes but fuck cloos, was in there a few weeks ago sitting at the counter and the staff were commenting on the news.

kcnbomy,Raleigh,18efsab,0.9,"Bourdain or Ramsay said seafood should smell like brine (salt water), never fishy or what you'd expect a fish to smell like. So a fishy smell, more than taste, would be a red flag."

I probably won't ever go back. 😩

Edit to add: I did notice my tuna was ""whitish"" more than a pink tone"
kcnkv2r,Raleigh,18efsab,0.2,"Good lord I feel lucky. My husband and I got takeout from there the night of 12/1. We got mostly cooked food, except for the tuna tataki though that isn't completely raw. Maybe it's because we didn't have sushi or perhaps because we didn't dine-in? He did sit at the bar while he waited for our order to ve ready though. Either way I feel like we dodged a bullet."
kcot51z,Raleigh,18efsab,-0.5,"Some years ago I was to photograph a wedding, and when I arrived on the scene the whole entire wedding party had gotten food poisoning from the rehearsal dinner. Props to them for going through with the ceremony and the post ceremony photos. While nobody passed out or was sick during the ceremony, they all looked like they were doing poorly. I ended up not collecting the remainder of their fees."
kcn5df4,Raleigh,18efsab,-0.6,Geez some guy missed his rehearsal dinner because of this. Don’t see how they will be able to stay in business.
kcn98qt,Raleigh,18efsab,-0.3,"If I remember right that place was a similar (Japanese or Chinese, I think) restaurant before it became sushi 9. It closed down after a rash of something similar. I remember all my friends I went to college with at the time bitching about how everyone who ate there got sick. That was right before It was remodeled. That was years and years ago though. I wonder if that was the same owners."
kcnc7mv,Raleigh,18efsab,0.0,what was their health rating before this?
kcnhp69,Raleigh,18efsab,0.9,"If you walk into a restaurant that sells raw fish and you smell fish, walk out!! Properly chilled fish and fresh fish don't smell ""fishy"" they smell like water, ocean, salt, etc. Unless the fish is a foot or less from your face, you shouldn't smell ""fishiness."" This applies to grocery store fish sections too! I walked into an Aldi one day and told a manager that their entire fish section was the wrong temperature because it smelled like salmon had taken over. 😨 Even raw meat doesn't smell ""meat-y"" when it's fresh and properly chilled, it smells slightly game-y but mostly iron-y due to blood; otherwise, you smell nothing."
kcnqnhb,Raleigh,18efsab,-0.7,I’ve only eaten Sushi Nine once. A family member brought over carry-out… the night before this outbreak. Feel like I dodged a very unhappy bullet.
